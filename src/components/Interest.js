        <p>Apart from being a software developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. Sports is an integral part of my life. I play all kind of sports but the favourite ones would be Cricket, Soccer, Volleyball and Table tennis. During the warmer months here in San Francisco, I enjoy trekking.</p>
        <p className="mb-0">When forced indoors, I am an aspiring singer, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the software development world.</p>
